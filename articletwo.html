  	<div id="header">Light Pollution: Obstructs from Viewing the Wonders of Celestial Universe
  	</div>
<br/>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p class="d">We grew up seeing countless stars, their constellations and numerous planets in the dark night sky through our windows. Observing these starry night skies tempted our astronomical desires. But in recent years, doing these stargazing has become quite difficult as stars are disappearing. Stars are passing out from our sight and we cannot observe them properly with our naked eyes. thus Light Pollution comes as it blocks our view to these celestial objects.
<br/><br/>

Light pollution is a new term for us as we don't hear it quite often. It's slightly different from other pollutions. Artificial light such as bulbs, street lights, building lights etc cause a different kind of pollution, which is known as light pollution. These artificial light scatters on a large scale and raises night sky luminance. Therefore we cannot observe the night sky naturally.
<br/><br/>

A report published in Science Advances shows that about <b>80%</b> of people live under light-polluted skies and <b>30%</b> of the world's population cannot see Milky Way galaxy from their homes. IDA (International Dark-Sky Association) also published an article reporting that light pollution is increasing worldwide at twice the rate of global population growth and eight of ten people live under the light-polluted night sky.
<br/><br/>

Dark night skies are essential for stargazing and therefore a scale has been invented to measure the brightness of a night sky based on how many objects are visible in a certain place. An amateur astronomer named Jhon E. Bortle invented the scale which also known as the Bortle scale. This scale is based on the visual observation of the night sky. Bortle scale defines the brightness of night sky using 9 Classes where the higher you go, the fainter the celestial object gets. It also tracks how much light pollution is occurring in a certain place. Generally, Class 1-4 is ideal for stargazing.
<br/><br/>


Light pollution is considered a curse in the astronomical field. It obstructs astronomers from viewing the celestial objects in the dark night sky through naked eyes. Therefore they must use a telescope to observe them. But in addition to skyglow, artificial light travels into the tube of the telescope and by reflecting inside it reaches the eye lens. Thus astronomers cannot observe these celestial objects properly.
<br/></br>

We all know that artificial light has revolutionized our world. But every good things has its negative sides and so as artificial light. Besides occurring pollution, artificial light effects on our biological clock, disrupt ecosystems and waste energy. So it needs no telling the importance of reducing light pollution. To do that, we can cover the upper part of the light bulb with a shield so that the light escaping from the bulb goes downward and we can also use light sensors to turn off unneeded outdoor lights. Thus artificial light will no longer scatter up to the sky. Also, we can use sodium light instead of LED-blue light as blue light scatters more than yellow or red light in the earth's atmosphere. Thus we will be able to diminish a good amount of light pollution, save energy and increase our viewable distance.
<br/><br/>

When someone sees a sky filled with countless stars and other celestial objects, it makes him wonder how small we are! How big the universe is! It also makes him curious about our planet, stars, galaxies, nebulae, black holes and lots more! That's how we learn astronomy and fall in love with astronomy. So to dive into the ocean of stars and to connect ourselves with them, we all must be conscious about eliminating light pollution. Thus we will be able to save our skies from being fainted and observe the raw beauty of night skies.</p>
